# DuitNowImg2CSV

## Problem Statement
As a merchant in Malaysia using DuitNow or QR payments for transactions, tracking sales can be challenging. This repository aims to address this issue by converting image-based receipts into CSV format for easier sales tracking.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to extract receipt data from QR codes and convert it into a CSV format.

## Testing Sample
The initial testing will use receipts from MAE, with plans to expand once the MAE set is fully processed.
